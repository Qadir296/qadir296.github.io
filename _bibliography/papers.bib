abstract = {Due to the rapidly increasing number of Internet-connected objects, a huge amount of data is created, stored, and shared. Depending on the use case, this data is visualized, cleaned, checked, visualized, and processed for various purposes. However, this data may encounter many problems such as inaccuracy, duplication, absence, etc. Such issues can be regarded as anomalies that deviate from a referential point, which can be caused by malicious attackers, abnormal behavior of systems, and a failure of devices, transmission channels, or data processing units. Anomaly detection is still one of the most important issues in cybersecurity, especially when it comes to system monitoring, automated forensics, and post-mortem analysis, which require anomaly detection mechanisms. In the literature, different approaches have been developed to detect anomalies, which can be classified as statistic-based, semantic-based, clustering-based, classification-based, and deep learning-based, depending on the algorithms used. This survey focuses on knowledge-based approaches, a sub-category of semantic-based approaches, as opposed to statistical/learning approaches. We provide a detailed comparison of the recent work in knowledge-based subcategories, namely, rule-based, score-based, and hybrid. We described the components of a knowledge-based system and the steps required to process raw data for anomaly detection. Furthermore, we have collected for each approach, when available, information about its semantic expressiveness, computational complexity, and application domain. Finally, we identify the challenges and discuss some future research directions in knowledge-based anomaly detection. Identifying such approaches and challenges can help cybersecurity engineers design better models that meet their application requirements.}

abstract="As part of the evolution toward an era of Web 3.0, the Internet of Things (IoT) bridges physical smart devices to digital world to enhance services for consumer convenience. However, the rapid increase of IoT devices led also to the inheritance of security, privacy, and trust problems, already well-known in traditional networks, making IoT devices even more vulnerable. To be able to detect anomalies and protect such IoT devices from cyberattacks, different techniques have been proposed in the literature using diverse approaches going from the logic-based (knowledge bases and ontologies) ones to the statistical ones (Machine Learning-ML/Deep Learning-DL). In this paper, we focus on the later approaches (ML/DL) to identify, reproduce, evaluate, and compare different state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection in IoT environments, along with the main datasets used in such research works. Once suitable ML models and datasets are identified, we investigated the potential for enhancing them by incorporating a feature selection algorithm. This aims to reduce the dataset's dimensionality while concurrently improving performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.",

abstract = {The widespread adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized user experiences but also raised concerns about security and privacy. To effectively safeguard against such cyber-threats, there is a need for approaches that can efficiently understand the usages of users’ IoT devices, applications, and data to better detect suspicious activities and protect users’ sensitive information within specific contexts. The semantic modeling capabilities of Knowledge Base System (KBS), make them well-suited for addressing these issues. From a semantics point of view, an anomaly in KBS can be modeled by a fragment of rules that can lead to inconsistencies inside the logical framework. Therefore, we map the anomaly detection problem to the inconsistency checkingproblem in KBS. As consistency checking is a hard problem, we introduce in this paper a new computational approach that reduces the complexity of the reasoning process by taking into account, in the logical modeling, theintrinsic idiosyncrasies of the application domain. We first introduce an algorithm for Knowledge Base (KB) rewriting into a context-based KB. Then, we detail our Lightweight Contextual Derivation Algorithm (LCDA) for inconsistency checking in KBS. Further, we propose an improvement of LCDA by adding parallelization, in ParallelLCDA (PLCDA), to accelerate the derivation process. We implemented and tested our algorithms in a practical use case in a smart home to demonstrate their effectiveness in the cybersecurity domain. Based on the obtained results, LCDA and PLCDA yield promising results in terms of response time in comparison with the regular logical chasing derivation approach.}
