Hi, thanks for visiting! 👋

I am a **Cybersecurity researcher** with a PhD from **Sorbonne University, France**, working at the intersection of **IoT security**, **AI-based intrusion detection**, and **knowledge-based systems**.

Previously, I conducted research and development at **Inria**, where I contributed to **ETSI standards** related to **IoT resource discovery** and **asynchronous contact tracing**.

My research focuses on designing **efficient and explainable security mechanisms** for large-scale and resource-constrained IoT environments. I am particularly interested in combining **symbolic reasoning** with **data-driven approaches** to improve the robustness and interpretability of anomaly detection systems.

I am currently interested in **postdoctoral research positions** and **R&D roles** in cybersecurity, AI security, and explainable AI.

Outside of research, I enjoy staying active, traveling, and exploring new places. I have lived in France for several years and speak **French**.
