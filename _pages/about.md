Hey, Salut, Ciao! 👋
I am **Post doctoral researcher** at the Security and Systems Team at [LRE EPITA](https://www.lre.epita.fr/), working on the detection of attacks in Industrial Control Systems. 

Previously, I did my PhD from [Sorbonne University](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr), working with **Prof. Lina Mroueh**, **Dr. Nouredine Tamani**, and **Dr. Saad El Jaouhari** on Knowledge-based systems for cybersecurity. 

I have also contributed to **ETSI standards** related to **IoT resource discovery** and **asynchronous contact tracing** during my research internship at KAIROS Team Inria, Sophia Antipolis. 

My research focuses on designing **efficient and explainable security mechanisms** for large-scale and resource-constrained IoT environments. I am particularly interested in combining **symbolic reasoning** with **data-driven approaches** to improve the robustness and interpretability of anomaly detection systems.

Outside of research, I am a beginner photographer. I enjoy traveling, hiking, and reading.
